### 1.1.0 - Compatibility with standard functions

 * It is now possible to use any function in a lambda expression, through use of the `make_lambda_friendly` method (see documentation)
 * All methods from the `math.py` module are provided in a lambda-friendly way by the package for convenience
 * Updated documentation accordingly, and made main page clearer
 * Renamed class _InputEvaluator into _LambdaExpression

### 1.0.0 - First public version

 * Initial fork from [valid8](https://github.com/smarie/python-valid8) sources.
 * Added documentation and printability of expressions, which implied to properly handle operator precedence.
